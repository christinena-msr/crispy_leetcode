# Monthly LeetCode Challenge
This is where I will be storing my submissions of the August LeetCode Challenge questions.

## Current Challenge: August
Inside the folder "augustChallenge" you will find a .js file that contains the problem statement, my successful submission, its results, and my thought process. 
I will primarily use this github as a way to document and review my algorithm practice. 

## Example
Problem Statement:
